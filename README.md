## An app to make dance notes

### Here I am sharing an app I made for the purpose of noting down dance sets, which might be helpful for you as well. It is free of charge, virus free, and Android only. You are very welcome to download and report any problems or improvement suggestions to me!
### It supports
### •       dynamically insert/modify/delete a segment of a dance set
### •       porting segments between sets by copy/cut and paste
### •       groupings of dance sets
### •       adding a music to each set
### •       linking each dance set with images, videos, or URL resources
### •       import and export dance sets, to support porting your dance data to another android device
